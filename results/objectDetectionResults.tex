\section{Object detection Results}
\label{sec:objectDetectionResults}

The first approach is to train object detection models.
For this, the \ac{YOLO}v7 and the \ac{GELAN}-c and \ac{GELAN}-e model versions from \ac{YOLO}v9 are trained.
After conducting a large number of experiments with different models and versions of datasets, the best results are obtained.
The best performance scores are obtained from an experiment with the \ac{GELAN}-e model, which outperformed the other models' accuracy.
These results are acquired by fine-tuning a model pre-trained on the COCO dataset.
The onlySwitchesLeftRight sub-dataset from RailSem19 is used to train the model (\autoref{sec:usedDatasetsYOLOs}).
\autoref{fig:objectDetectionResultsMetrics} shows performance graphs like the F1 Curve and the Precision-Recall Curve, as well as the confusion matrix with both classes.

\noindent However, as visualized in \autoref{fig:objectDetectionResultsMetrics} the Precision-Recall Curve and the F1 Curve show unsatisfying results.
The confusion matrix also indicates that the model's prediction performances are below 50\% for both classes.
The reason for that presumably lies in the complexity of the task.
Switches look similar to rails, and predicting switch states further increases the difficulty because the only difference is the start of the switch.
Additionally, the \ac{GT} bounding boxes of most switch labels are very small.
As shown in \autoref{fig:annotationAnalysis}, most crops have widths of about 0.02 and heights of about 0.015 relative to the dataset images.
Converted into pixels with the image resolution of $1920 \times 1080$, this results in crops with heights of around 22 pixels and widths of around 29 pixels.
RailSem19 \cite{railsem19dataset} also states that this task is difficult.
In one of their experiments, they only considered the crops of $switch\_left$ and $switch\_right$ labels and turned it into a classification task.
Even after they expanded the crops vertically by 125\% and horizontally by 30\% to increase the context, they had many images with dimensions below 28 pixels.
After dropping those and training a DenseNet161, the accuracy only achieved 67\%.

\noindent Because of the complexity of this task and the unsatisfactory results, it cannot be assumed that object detection models correctly predict switch states.
Therefore, the approach of predicting the direction of the train with such a model is discarded.
A fundamentally different approach must be found, making further experiments with semantic segmentation models unnecessary.
