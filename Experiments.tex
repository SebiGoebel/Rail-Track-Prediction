%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Kurze Einf√ºhrung %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This chapter describes all experiments conducted in this work to either develop a functional rail track prediction system or improve existing methods.
The structure can be roughly divided into the following categories:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For an initial approach to combine object detection with semantic segmentation, experiments with object detectors are conducted and described in \autoref{sec:objectDetectionExperiments}.
    \item TEP-Net \cite{tepNet2024} is chosen as the new baseline for further improvements in accuracy and robustness. Experiments include an adapted cropping mechanism for inference (\autoref{sec:autocropExperiments}) and various changes in the model architecture (\autoref{sec:improvedTEPNETExperiments}).
    \item An additional approach to enhancing robustness involves integrating temporal information, thereby addressing the limitation of single-frame-based methods. Experiments are depicted in \autoref{sec:temporalModelsExperiments}.
\end{enumerate}
