\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{sec:stateOfTheArt}

To get an idea of possible solutions and the most promising approaches. 
There are many different kinds of vision tasks based on image input.
This chapter introduces to different vision tasks and their approaches to serve as an overview.
Then, the most promising approaches for the rail track prediction use case are selected and further pursued for comparison.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Image Classification
    \item Object Detection
    \item Semantic Segmentation (detection und keine direction prediction) hat normalerweise probleme wenn mehrere rails in der scene sind --> weichen schwer trennbar weil der pixelhaufen dazwischen irgendwas ist
    \item Instance Segmentation
    \item panoptic Segmentation
    \item line detection (detection und keine direction prediction) anzahl der rails in einer scene ist das problem
\end{itemize}

was gibt es?\\
was gibt es in der rail domaine?\\
