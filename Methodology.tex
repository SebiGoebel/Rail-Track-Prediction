%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Kurze Einf√ºhrung %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, the methodology of this work is described.
In <section> used and implemented models are explained.
<section> describes datasets, which are used to train and evaluate models and other algorithms.
The data augmentation of these datasets is depicted in <section>.
<section> deals with loss functions. After that, setups for training and inference measurements are described in <section> and <section>.
Keep in mind that the main contributions of this work include three parts:
1. an initial approach to combine object detection with semantic segmentation;
2. TEP-Net \cite{tepNet2024} is the new baseline for further experiments to improve this model's accuracy and robustness;
3. An RNN is integrated into the model to increase robustness further.
