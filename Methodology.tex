%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Kurze Einf√ºhrung %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section, the methodology of this work is described.
In \autoref{sec:usedModels} used and implemented models are explained.
\autoref{sec:usedDatasets} describes datasets, which are used to train and evaluate models and other algorithms.
The data augmentation of these datasets is depicted in \autoref{sec:dataaugmentation}.
\autoref{sec:lossFunction} deals with loss functions.
After that, setups for training and inference measurements are described in \autoref{sec:trainigsSetup} and \autoref{sec:measuringInference}.
The three main approaches pursued in this study are:
%1. An initial approach to combine object detection with semantic segmentation;
%2. TEP-Net \cite{tepNet2024} is the new baseline for further experiments to improve this model's accuracy and robustness;
%3. An RNN is integrated into the model to increase robustness further;

%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item An initial approach to combine object detection with semantic segmentation.
%    \item TEP-Net \cite{tepNet2024} is the new baseline for further improvements in accuracy and robustness.
%    \item An RNN is integrated aiming to eliminate the limitation of single-frame-based approaches.
%\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Firstly, an initial approach was taken that aimed to combine object detection and semantic segmentation.
    However, due to unsatisfactory results, this methodology was deemed ineffective, leading to the pursuit of a fundamentally different solution.
    \item Secondly, \ac{TEP}-Net \cite{tepNet2024} was chosen as the new baseline for further experiments.
    Improvements are implemented with a specific focus on correct path prediction in the presence of switches.
    \item Thirdly, as further improvements are anticipated through the use of the temporal component with \ac{RNN}s, the system was adjusted to accept video information rather than single frames as input.
    Thus, the data loading logic was adapted and models were modified.
    Additionally, a temporal dataset was created.
    To minimize the workload for annotation, an auto labeler was developed utilizing the improved single-frame-based model.
\end{enumerate}
