%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Kurze Einf√ºhrung %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The results of all experiments conducted in this work are described in this chapter.
This chapter's categorization follows the one of the experiments.
First, results of experiments with object detection models are described in \autoref{sec:objectDetectionResults}.
After that results of various cropping mechanisms for inference are depicted in \autoref{sec:autocropResults}.
\autoref{improvedTEPNetResults} gives insights about experiments with different single-frame-based model architectures and \autoref{sec:qualitativeComparison} qualitatively compares the original model of \cite{tepNet2024} with the adapted one.
\autoref{sec:temporalModelsResults} describes the results of approaches that incorporate temporal information to enhance robustness.
